# Whale-Classifier-First-Attempt
This script was written for my first Kaggle competition. The idea is to classify whales based only on images of their tail flukes. The most challenging aspect of the problem is that each whale has an average of about three photos on which to train. 

I chose this challenge primarily because it looked interesting, and I wanted to practice Python's "scikit-learn" package. The model itself does not work very well (it scored roughly 10% on the test set), but through interaction with the Kaggle community I have gained valuable insights as to how my model can be improved.

In my next attempt at the problem (which will occur after I play around with some other, more straightforward datasets first), I plan to use convolutional neural nets (via the package "Keras"), since they are particularly good at image recognition.
